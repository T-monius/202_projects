## Guided Project: A Personal Profile

### Understanding
- 

### Task
- Complete the following steps:

1. Start a new HTML file with your HTML skeleton, and change the page title to "My Profile."

2. Add your content to the document's body. Use plain text for now; we'll add the HTML below. The content should include your:

  + name, e.g., `Joe Lindt`
  + job title, e.g., `Future Front-end Developer`
  + Your GitHub link (e.g., `https://github.com/joelindtisnotarealperson`)
  + a list of five web page links identified as `My Top 5 Links`
  + The content won't be pretty at this point, but that's okay.

3. Convert the name to an h1 heading.

4. Convert the job title to an h2 heading.

5. Convert the GitHub profile to a link (an anchor).

6. Use a strong element to give the GitHub link a label, `GitHub Profile:`, that has some visual importance.

7. Wrap the label and link for your GitHub profile in a paragraph.

8. Enclose the "My Top 5 Links" title in an h3 heading.

9. Convert the descriptions for each of your top 5 links to an anchor.

10. Enclose your list of top links (not including the heading) in an ordered list (ol element). Feel free to look up ordered lists in the MDN documentation or elsewhere on the Web.

11. Validate your HTML at W3C!
