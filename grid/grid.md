## Grid Notes

### Understanding
1. Change the heading
  + Must re-align it
  + Fill the background color
2. Make the header navigation bar horizontal and position elements
3. Re-position the `aside`s and the `article`s in the main content area
  + 5 total elements
  + 3 side-by-side
  + 2 side-by-side below those three
4. ^ I can do all of this in one big grid...

### Task
- Make all your modifications to the CSS file; don't make any changes to the HTML. Do not use any `float`, `position`, or `flex` properties, and don't convert any elements to `inline-block`. Use Grid features instead.

Flex and Grid naturally work in concert. This contrived project intentionally restricts the use of Flex to force you to use Grid.

This project may be hard if you have no prior exposure to Grid. Don't waste a lot of time struggling with it; check the solutions if you get stuck. We don't expect you to learn Grid in this course, merely see it in action.

As usual, there are different ways to complete this project. Don't worry if your CSS looks different, as long as it meets the requirements.
