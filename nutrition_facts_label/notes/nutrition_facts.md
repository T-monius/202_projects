## Nutrition Facts

### Understanding
- The sizing and styling may be arbitrarily particular
  + The width is apparently `676px`, very arbitrary
  + This may have an impact an how long it takes to duplicate
- There are 3-5 sections of facts
  + I can make those each block level elements containing lists, tables, or other elements
  + There is space between the outer border of the label and the inner contents
    * Can use margin or padding of each inner element to create the space
    * The space is consistent all around the edges of the label
  1. Heading followed by two `<p>` elements or smaller headings
  2. A table or 3 tables depending on styling for two solid lines separating areas of the table
    * This table can have a footer with the asterisk for meaining of percent daily values
  3. A table with an offset header for columns
    * Header for rows
