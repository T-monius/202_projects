## Flex Notes

### Understanding
- Resize the background around the header and center it
  + May do this with flexbox since it's necessary to center it vertically and horizontally
- The navigation menu needs to line up horizontally
  + Do this with flex
  + The display of the container needs to change
- The `aside`s and main text content in the main section need to be horizontal
  + Turn the main section into a flex box
- Horizontal footer
  + Flex box


### Task
- Reproduce the given project files to render as teh example project
- Make all your modifications to the CSS file; don't make any changes to the HTML. Do not use any `float`, `position`, or `grid` properties, and don't convert any elements to `inline-block`. Use Flex features instead.

Flex and Grid naturally work in concert. This contrived project intentionally restricts the use of Grid to force you to use Flex.
